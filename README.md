A structured IPython Notebook project with organized Python packages for enhanced data analysis.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher

### Setup

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   In the root directory, run:

   ```sh
   python3.10 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install Poetry:**

   Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/) for dependency management:

   ```sh

### Running Tests

To execute all tests, run the following command (add `-v` for verbose output):

```sh
poetry run pytest
```

### Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The CI pipeline includes:

- Building the project
- Running unit tests on every push
